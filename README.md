Personalized Movie Recommendation System
Project Overview

This project implements a hybrid recommendation system that provides personalized movie suggestions using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. The system is trained and evaluated on the MovieLens dataset to demonstrate effective recommendation strategies.

Features

Collaborative Filtering:

User-User and Item-Item similarity using cosine similarity.

Matrix Factorization:

Implemented SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) to predict missing ratings.

Evaluation:

Performance measured using Precision@K, Recall@K, and RMSE.

Comparison:

Comparison of collaborative filtering and matrix factorization to identify the best-performing approach.

Dataset

MovieLens 100K dataset: Link to dataset

Contains 100,000 ratings from 943 users on 1,682 movies.
