Hybrid Movie Recommendation SystemA comprehensive implementation of a hybrid movie recommendation system that combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide personalized movie suggestions. This project explores multiple recommendation strategies and evaluates their performance on the classic MovieLens 100k dataset.🌟 Key FeaturesMultiple Models: Implements three distinct recommendation approaches:Collaborative Filtering: Using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to model user-item interactions.Content-Based Filtering: Using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity on movie genres to find similar items.Hybrid System: A weighted combination of SVD and Content-Based models to leverage the strengths of both.In-depth Evaluation: Assesses model performance using industry-standard metrics, including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for rating prediction and Precision@K/Recall@K for ranking quality.Modular Codebase: The project is structured with modular, reusable functions for data loading, model training, and evaluation, making it easy to understand and extend.🛠️ Methodology1. Collaborative Filtering (SVD)This model is based on Matrix Factorization, which uncovers latent factors in the user-item rating matrix. The SVD algorithm from the surprise library is used to predict a user's rating for a movie they haven't seen yet.2. Content-Based FilteringThis model recommends items based on their properties. Movie genres were vectorized using TF-IDF, and a Cosine Similarity matrix was computed to find movies with similar genre profiles. This helps solve the "cold start" problem for new users.3. Hybrid RecommenderThe final model combines the outputs of the two models above. The final score for a recommendation is a weighted average:Final Score = (α * SVD_Score) + ((1 - α) * Content_Score)This allows for a balance between the "wisdom of the crowd" (collaborative) and item-specific properties (content-based).📊 DatasetThis project uses the MovieLens 100k Dataset, which contains 100,000 ratings from 943 users on 1,682 movies. You can find the dataset here.🚀 Getting StartedFollow these instructions to set up the project environment and run the evaluation.1. PrerequisitesConda package manager2. InstallationFirst, clone the repository to your local machine:git clone [https://github.com/rahulsiripuram5/Rec-SyS.git](https://github.com/rahulsiripuram5/Rec-SyS.git)
cd Rec-SyS
Next, create the Conda environment using the provided file. This will install all necessary libraries, including pandas, scikit-learn, and scikit-surprise.conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate recsys_env
(Note: You will need to create the environment.yml file by running conda env export > environment.yml from your activated environment.)3. UsageThe main script to run the full training and evaluation pipeline is evaluate_hybrid.py.python src/evaluate_hybrid.py
This script will:Load the dataset.Train the SVD model and report its RMSE.Build the content-based similarity matrix.Loop through all users to generate hybrid recommendations.Calculate and print the final average Precision@10 and Recall@10 for the hybrid model.📈 Evaluation ResultsThe hybrid model was evaluated on its ability to predict movies a user would rate highly (4 or 5 stars).MetricScoreDescriptionRMSE (SVD)0.9396The model's rating predictions are, on average, off by only 0.94 stars on a 5-star scale.Average Precision@100.3232On average, 32.3% of the top 10 recommended items were relevant hits, indicating high quality recommendations.Average Recall@100.0620The model successfully found 6.2% of all relevant items for a user within its top 10 list.These results demonstrate a well-performing system that accurately predicts ratings and excels at ranking highly relevant items at the top of its recommendation lists.📂 Project Structure├── .gitignore
